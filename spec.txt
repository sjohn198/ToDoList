Features:
1. Comprehensive list of all tasks w/ their due dates.
    - Needs some sort of access to system clock
2. "My Day"-esque page for current tasks for a work session.
    - Tasks due today will default to being here
3. Undated lists feature, e.g. grocery lists
4. Retro arcadey visuals
5. Search tasks and lists
6. Group tasks by job, class, etc.
    -Maybe color code
7. Completed tasks list and when they were completed.



Problems w/ Microsoft ToDo:
1. Default tasks are not created with a due date. Most tasks have a due date so that should be the default
2. Can put tasks into groups but those groups get isolated from the rest.


Extra:
1. Sync with Email
2. Calendar/Visualization Feature 
    -Not really a time associated w/ each task so not a perfect fit
